Setting up AWS infrastructure :
These two scripts files and one json file is Focused on using AWS CloudFormation to set up and tear down our networking resources including Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Internet Gateway, Route Table and Route.

Description :
Firstly, a JSON formatted text file as a template needs to be created as blueprints for building our AWS resources. This template describes all networking resources and relationship between them used to set up infrastructure. Then we use this template to crate a stack. After this stack created, our all resources are up and running.

Instruction :
We have two scripts contained in this folder, one is to crate a stack, another one is to terminate a stack. To run these two scripts, we need to run our script and pass the Stcak_Name into as the first parameter in our shell, that is, we need to run "sh script_name stack_name" command line in our shell
